# Software Code of Conduct
A code of conduct for software companies and their employees. Standards to live by when developing human friendly code.

## The Software Code of Conduct
The software developed with this code of conduct is human friendly and:
* Doesn't lie
* Doesn't kill
* Doesn't steal
* Doesn't harass in any way

## As a software organisation and employer
We strive to live by the Software Code of Conduct. That means that the software we make should follow the code of conduct described here. 

## As a software developer and employee
Working in a organisation following the Software Code of Conduct I have the possibility and responsibility to create software that follows the code of conducts described here.

## How to use it?
Instead of using this code of conduct to distribute blame and point fingers, it should be used as a way to make employers and employees aware of their own actions and how to create more human friendly software. There will always be interpretations of what the code of conduct means.

One way of living by this code of conduct is to discuss (publicly) what you get out of it, what this means for your software and where you see your software could be better.

## What is this?
A take on "[Guilds, Ethics, and Software Engineering as one of The Professions](https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-software-engineering-a-profession-68d1900112fc)". Develop this code of conduct into something companies will follow and developers to demand (and then follow) when they apply for a job.

Another source for inspiration is Nodejs' [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Would be nice to develop the code of conduct over time and let companies apply to a certain version.
