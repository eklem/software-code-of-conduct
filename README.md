# Software code of conduct
A code of conduct for software companies and their employees. Standards to live by when developing code.

## As a software company and employer
...

## As a software developer and employee
...

## What is this?
A take on "[Guilds, Ethics, and Software Engineering as one of The Professions](https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-software-engineering-a-profession-68d1900112fc)". Develop this code of conduct into something companies will follow and developers to demand (and then follow) when they apply for a job.

Another source for inspiration is Nodejs' [code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Would be nice to develop the code of conduct over time and let companies apply to a certain version.
